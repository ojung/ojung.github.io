                        Mbr targeting is a real-time bidding company. It
                        provides a demand side- and data management platform
                        allowing advertisers to run campaigns on multiple ad
                        exchanges.  The company specializes in user-centric
                        optimization using machine learning algorithms.  The system
                        scales to above 100.000 requests per second with a latency
                        of below 100ms.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As data engineer I used and maintained a 1000 core
                        petabyte-size hadoop cluster and another 250 core 500Tb
                        HBase cluster. I help ingest terabytes of data per day.
                        Apart from that I was also involved in planning, designing
                        and implementing services for use in real-time-bidding
                        systems and a data management platform with high
                        requirements for low latency and high throughput. Because
                        of the demanding performance requirements of our components
                        I learned a lot about production JVM systems. As part of a
                        small team of data engineers I took part in the shared
                        responsibility for our software components as well as for
                        organizational tasks such as hiring and mentoring.
